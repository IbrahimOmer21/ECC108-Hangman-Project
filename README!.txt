Overview:
This Hangman project was created to level up our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills. It's a fun way to dive into code while learning about OOP concepts and making our code cleaner and easier to understand.

The game is simple: it randomly picks a word, and you have to guess it letter by letter. If you guess right, the word starts to reveal itself. But if you're wrong, parts of a stick figure get drawn â€” representing the hangman. Keep guessing until you crack the word or the hangman is complete!

How to Play:
1.Run the program.
2.The game will randomly select a word from its word bank.
3.Guess letters one at a time by entering them via keyboard input.
4.If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
5.If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
6.Continue guessing until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman figure is complete.
7.If you guess the word correctly, you win! You'll be prompted to retry.
8.If the hangman figure is complete before you guess the word, you lose. You'll also be prompted to retry.
